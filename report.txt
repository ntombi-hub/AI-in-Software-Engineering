Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
Q1 – AI-driven code generation tools

Answer: GitHub Copilot reduces development time by suggesting code snippets, boilerplate, and logic. It helps with autocomplete, repetitive tasks, and learning new APIs.

Limitations: Can suggest incorrect or insecure code; cannot fully understand project context; human review is required.

Q2 – Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning in Bug Detection

Supervised: Uses labeled datasets (bug/no bug) to train a model for predicting issues.

Unsupervised: Finds anomalies or patterns in code without labeled data; useful for detecting unknown bugs.

Q3 – Bias Mitigation

AI models personalizing UX may favor certain user groups, leading to unfair experiences.

Mitigation ensures equitable recommendations for all users.

Case Study: AIOps

Automates deployment pipelines, improving efficiency.

Examples:

Automated rollback when a deployment fails

Predicting resource usage to avoid downtime
